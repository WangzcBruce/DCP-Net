# DCP-Net: Distributed Collaborative Perception Network

DCP-Net is a novel framework designed to enhance remote sensing semantic segmentation through distributed collaborative perception. This project builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in the "who2com" and "when2com" frameworks.

## Background

Our DCP-Net leverages and extends the baseline established by [who2com](https://github.com/GT-RIPL/MultiAgentPerception) and [when2com](https://github.com/GT-RIPL/MultiAgentPerception), which were developed as part of the research efforts at GT-RIPL. These projects explore the dynamics of communication and collaboration among multiple agents in perception tasks, laying the groundwork for our enhancements.

## Contributions

While DCP-Net draws on the initial ideas of who2com and when2com, it introduces significant improvements and optimizations specifically tailored for the challenges of remote sensing:
- **Self-Mutual Information Match Module**: Identifies optimal collaboration opportunities more efficiently.
- **Related Feature Fusion Module**: Addresses the misalignment issues inherent in multi-angle remote sensing data collection.

Our modifications and extensions are designed to optimize performance in environments characterized by limited and unreliable communication channels, a common scenario in remote sensing applications.

## Acknowledgements

We acknowledge and are grateful for the pioneering work done by the creators of who2com and when2com. Their open-source projects have been instrumental in shaping the initial stages of our development.
